Herb Identification Game

This project is a simple Java Swing application that helps users learn and identify common medicinal herbs. The program displays an herb image and lets the user guess the herb name. It includes hints, scoring, and basic information about each herb.

Features

Shows herb details when the user is out of chances

Ends with a final score summary

How It Works

The game loads a predefined list of herbs. Each herb includes:

A hint

Images are expected to be stored in the project under:

/images/<herb_name_in_lowercase>.png


Example:

The GUI is built using Java Swing with a simple layout:
